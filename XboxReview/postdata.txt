        "game_review": "I honestly don't know what they were trying to go for with this game, going from such a dark and gritty first game to this, which is one of the most upbeat games I've ever had the mis pleasure of playing. It's fun for the first week, admittedly, but only then if you have friends to play it with. The map is nice, though, and there's definitely a large selection of races to do. Pick it up if you like racing games.",

        "game_review": "Minecraft! That world of wonder that started it all for me. I was never much of a sand box type gamer until I fell in love with Minecraft. This particular version is very nice. You are able to play on your XBOX 360 and this is the version I first played Minecraft on. Minecraft is a world where you build, create, and survive in a voxel universe. The sky is really the limit for aspiring builders. I bought this one for my son who is far away from me. We play together via Xbox Live and I can say that Minecraft has brought my family closer together. I felt comfortable purchasing it originally for them ( and myself!) when they were younger, and it has stood the test of time with both my children, being a game they like to return to and never seem to get bored with. I now own every version possible of this game and I love it!",

        "game_review": "Finally the sequel this saga deserved, currently played 4 hours and I LOVE IT. The map designs are incredible and beautiful, the gameplay is solid and i haven't experienced any kind of bugs and the new mechanics feel great and organic with the rest of the movement set.\\r\\nThe new \\\"flashbacks\\\" levels are my favourite addition, they are literally extreme bonus levels that you will need to clear with skill, timing and brain, the best is that the soundtrack for this levels are the beloved and original crash 1 soundtrack.\\r\\nFinally it looks like the replayability of this game is N.SANE, have to collect all the boxes, have to pass the levels without dying more than 3 times, have to recollect certain quantities of wumpa fruit, time trails and the new inverted mode that adds another 6 gems. So for each level you will have to obtain 12 gems and the relic if you want to 100% complete the game.\\r\\nAs a huge fan of Crash since i was 5 years old, thank you Toys for Bob, you nailed it.",

        "game_review": "I remember the first FS from Microsoft when I was just a kid and back then FPS wasn't even a consideration or a metric that we would judge any computer game. The marvel that a home pc could emerge you in a world that was only available to the extremely rich or the military was exceptional for the time and took me away on many impossible journeys and adventures. Even though it was just a wire frame representation that didn't matter and that an FPS of 7 or 8 was seen as remarkable for the time, the flag ship release was a game changer then, fast forward to today and the current 2020 version is something that should be considered as equally if not more ground breaking than its initial outing, The amazing technology that has gone into the production of this masterpiece will change the way we play games in the future, setting a standard for a new era in computing that is unparalleled by it's piers in the industry today. In the same way the realisation of the first truly 'open sandbox' game that was its maiden outing, this game pushes the envelope of what is possible in the modern connected world for the benefit of a fully spectacular immersion that is at times breath taking and enthralling way beyond the limits of mere FPS and loading times. This is a true beauty to behold and we should be thankful that it is even possible to witness even at a modest performance. The ignoble calls of it's detractors are only petty and will not last the test of time as this game progresses us into a future of hyper realistic immersion the limits of today's hardware will just be a footnote. This game stands above any other and should be rated on its gameplay alone as the only valid metric you need to consider.",
